## Branch Naming Conventions
When creating a branch, the branch name should be:
```
<issue number>-<branch type>-<specific changes made(separate by underscores)>
```
For example:
```
75-FEATURE-Add_usernames_and_password
```
Some of the common branch type includes:
- `FEATURE` - Feature branch
- `WIP` - **W**ork **I**n **P**rogress. This can be used as a sub-branch of a feature branch
- `FIX` - A branch fixing one particular bug

## Descriptive Suffixes
The following rule is copied from the contribution guideline of [AnubisLMS/Anubis](https://github.com/AnubisLMS/Anubis)

All Pull Requests and commit message should begin with one of our descriptive suffixes:

- FIX fix of something

Similarly for issues:
